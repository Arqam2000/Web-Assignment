    <h3>The Changing Educational Landscape</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Globalization of education has significantly influenced the systems and processes at all levels from preschool to higher education. Like other fields, education is in a constant flux; the purpose, the pedagogies, the content and the methods of assessments are continuously evolving. Parents and students want better quality of education that could facilitate a holistic development of personality, including a creative and critical mindset and a constructivist disposition. A crucial facet of education is to hone skills and knowledge for global citizenship and human capital. Research underscores trends and shifts in educational paradigms which are being practiced in the current global milieu. This evolution in education has a direct impact on the society and the economy of a country. Pakistan being an Islamic democratic state, needs to embrace diversity, modernity and all the 21st century ideas and skills, keeping in view its core values. This conference will help amalgamate the international practices with the national and local context.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Department of Education invites educationists, academicians, practitioners, teachers, and researchers to put forward their ideas, philosophies and findings at the 1st International Conference on Education (ICE 2022).</p>
